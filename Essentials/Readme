# ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE

These event trigger scripts **require the BaseInvokeEvent class** to work properly.
Before using any of the provided subclasses make sure you have **imported or downloaded the `BaseInvokeEvent.cs`** file into your Unity project.
If `BaseInvokeEvent.cs` is missing, all derived scripts will show errors or fail to run.
